Resources:

## Create the VPC in which resources will be allocated
  VPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCIDR
      EnableDnsHostnames: true
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Ref EnvironmentName

## Create the internet gateway to provide access to internet to resources into the VPC

    Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: Name

  InternetGatewayAttachment:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
    Properties:
      InternetGatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway
      VpcId: !Ref VPC


## Create the subnets of the VPC. Public and private subnets. Public for resources that can be accessed from/to internet and to provide Internet to the private subnets that my need it.
## Private subnets stands for resources that should not be exposed to the internet

## Create privates subnets first. They need to be attached to the VPC created, attach an AZ and Cidr block needs to be provided
## Note: Good practice to set MapPublicIpOnLaunch into false, even when you will avoid internet access from the Route tables

    Properties:
      Domain: vpc


## Create the NAT Gateways that will be allocated in the public subnets to serve internet access to the private subnets resources that may need it.
## You must attach it the desired public subnet and the EIP that were created
  NatGateway1:
    Type: AWS::EC2::NatGateway
